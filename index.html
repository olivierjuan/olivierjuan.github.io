<p>I am a Research Scientist at EDF R&D working on Optimization, AI, Reinforcement Learning and Operational research.</p>

<p>My main research interest is to improve optimization technics (such as branch&bound) with machine learning technics.</p>

<p>I then apply it in the context of Short Unit Commitment Problem or Smart Charging.</p>
