My name is Olivier Juan. I work at EDF R&D since 2008 in the OSIRIS department.

- Since 2019, I am Research Engineer Expert and my research activities are splitted three parts :
  - contributing the Apogène Software continuous improvement effort
  - contributing to new optimization topics of interest (smart charging for the EDF subsidiary [DREEV](https://www.dreev.com) a joint venture between EDF and [Nuvve](https://www.nuvve.com)). Some results: [in french](https://www.rte-france.com/actualites/vehicules-electriques-equilibrage-systeme-electrique), [in english thx to google](https://www-rte--france-com.translate.goog/actualites/vehicules-electriques-equilibrage-systeme-electrique?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
  - research topics on Combinatorial Optimization and Machine Learning.


- In 2012, I became project manager to conduct a complete rebuild of the software Apogée (short term unit commitment software of EDF). This work took a few years with the contribution of a bunch of smart and talented people. And in 2018, past and current contributors gathered to celebrate the successful commissioning of Apogène V2. This new version improved the overall operating cost of powerplant of EDF by a few percent.

    It now continues its journey with the commissioning of Apogène V3 in 2020 and Apogène V4 in 2021. In June 2022, Apogène won the IndusRO'2022 prize [See it here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6962864243234742273/) and on youtube [short version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRD5C2Kjug&ab_channel=ROADEF), [long version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBM6r-B8H8o&ab_channel=ROADEF)


- In 2008, I joined the OSIRIS department to work on operational research topics such as : Task Scheduling for maintenance planning, LNG Terminal Planning & Scheduling, Coal power plant combustion & polutant emission optimization. Later, I started working on short term unit commitment on the software Apogène V1. 


- From June 2007 to June 2008, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Ecole Central de Paris in the computer science department under the supervision of [Nikos Paragios](http://cvn.ecp.fr/personnel/nikos). I worked on combinatorial algorithms for medical imagining.


- From June 2006 to June 2007, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Western Ontario in the computer science department under the supervision of [Yuri Boykov](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~yboykov/) (now at university of Waterloo). I worked on Graph Cut and other combinatorial algorithm for computer vision.


- In 2006, I defended my PhD thesis in Computer Science and Mathematics with distinction at [Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (ENPC)](https://www.enpc.fr) titled "On Some Extensions of Level Sets and Graph Cuts & Their Applications to Image and Video Segmentation" (you can read it [here](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00001855/document)).


- In 2002, I obtained my Master Degree [Maths, Vision et Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com/) at Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Cachan (ENS Cachan), now [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/)
